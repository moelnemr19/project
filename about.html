          <h3>Socila Media About Messi:</h3>
          <p>
            Lionel Andres Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina
            and began playing football since his childhood. In 1995, he joined
            the youth team at Newell's Old Boys (a first-division football club
            based in Rosario). According to the British Encyclopedia, Messi's
            incredible skills caught the attention of prestigious clubs on both
            sides of the Atlantic. At the age of 13, he and his family moved to
            Barcelona where he began playing with the Barcelona under-14 team.
            He scored 21 goals in 14 matches for the youth team and quickly
            advanced to the first team. Messi participated in his first
            unofficial match with Barcelona when he was 16 years old, In the
            2004-2005 season, Messi, who was 17 years old at the time, became
            the youngest player and top scorer in the Spanish league. Despite
            his humble physique, with a height of 1.7 meters and a weight of 67
            kilograms, he was strong, balanced, and versatile on the field. He
            was fast, accurate, played with his left foot, distributed passes,
            and could easily penetrate through solid defenses, In 2005, Messi
            obtained Spanish citizenship, and the following year he and
            Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League (European club
            championship). The Argentine star played 778 matches with the
            Catalan team, a record that no other player in the club's history
            has achieved. Messi scored 672 goals with Barcelona, and won 10
            Spanish league titles and 4 UEFA Champions League titles In
            addition, he has won the Ballon d'Or award as the best football
            player in the world 6 times Messi's first international appearance
            was in 2005 as a substitute against Hungary, where he played for two
            minutes before being sent off. However, he quickly proved his worth
            in the national team and traveled to Germany to participate in the
            2006 World Cup. He also participated in the 2010 World Cup in South
            Africa, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil where Argentina reached the
            final, and the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In 2021, Messi wanted to
            apply for a free transfer, but Barcelona refused and said that
            whoever wants to buy Messi would have to pay 700 million euros (624
            million pounds sterling). However, those restrictions have now been
            lifted. According to the Argentine newspaper "Clarín" in a headline
            titled "Global Shock...Will Paris Saint-Germain be his new club?",
            the French club was considered "the main candidate to add him to its
            stars" such as Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. The newspaper added that
            "Messi is at the peak of his performance and with his eyes on the
            Qatar World Cup, he will continue to bet on European football",
            pointing out that he had been flirting with Paris Saint-Germain,
            which is owned by Qatar, for many years. Some Argentine teams have
            also started dreaming of getting his services, although the economic
            reality in this South American country, which is experiencing a
            severe recession, may make his return to his homeland a more
            surprising event. The hashtag "Welcome Leo" began to spread on
            Twitter, with pictures of Messi wearing the shirts of prestigious
            Argentine clubs such as Boca Juniors, River Plate, Newell's Old
            Boys, and San Lorenzo, as well as more humble clubs like Sarmiento.
            After much speculation, Lionel Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain. The
            Argentine star, who joined the City of Lights club on a free
            transfer deal, is set to earn 35 million euros annually, and this
            amount will not be subject to taxes, in addition to incentives and
            other variables, according to European media reports. It is worth
            mentioning that Messi is married to the fashion model Antonella
            Roccuzzo, and they have three children together, named Thiago,
            Mateo, and Tio.
